# Deep_learning_FCN_RoboND
The main objective is to Design a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation and Train the net for a given/recorded dataset from a quad-simulator, which contains mainly of target (woman in red), people, objects (buildings, trees, etc.) and the quad copter, to define the special information of the target and people from quadâ€™ front camera. Then Test the model on the simulator.
